The main focus of the project is to try and improve on the previous fraud detection models comparing various sampling techniques, classifiers, and performance metrics. We used a dataset generated by the transactions made by European card holders in September 2013. All the transactions were made in two days, so the dataset is highly skewed. To solve this issue, we used various sampling methods on the dataset since machine learning models would learn better from a balanced dataset. Here we also see why accuracy is not a good metric for our problem and explore other metrics that are widely used for dealing with unbalanced data such as precision, recall & AUC-PR.
